# GUIDE FAQ - Part 2
## FERTILIZING
### Can I fertilize during the summer?
Yes, but for most of you it is is best to go with *very* light applications, if any at all. As discussed in Step #7 above, nitrogen-based fertilizers encourages grass to grow. But the summer months are often times of stress for cool season grasses. Encouraging them to grow at this time is only going to exacerbate the effects that heat stress. Imagine if you were stranded in the dessert, doing what you could to survive; you probably wouldn’t take too kindly to be asked to spend your days lifting weights and running sprints.

The cooler your summers, the more you can feel comfortable fertilizing. Reciprocally, the hotter your summers, the less you want to fertilize. The most nitrogen I would apply would be three quarters of a pound and I would spread that over multiple applications. Use that amount in places with moderate summers . Use less - or none - in warmer places. I would advise that beginners not apply *any* nitrogen during months in which the average high is near or above 88 or 89°F.

Regardless of how much you apply, make sure you only use slow-release fertilizers during the summer. These are sometimes labeled as “organic,” not because they have anything to do with organic agriculture but because they are derived from naturally occurring sources like composted plants or manure. They tend to release their nutrients slowly over time which helps lessen the stress your grass experiences. Milorganite, which was the fertilizer I recommended for beginners in the main post is a slow-release fertilizer, so if you already bought that there is no need to buy an additional product for summer. Another fertilizer I linked to and recommended in the main post, [XGN](https://thelawncarenut.com/collections/granular-fertilizer/products/8-1-8-fertilizer), would also be a good summer choice. Other slow release fertilizers that can be found in big box stores include: [Espoma Organic Lawn Food](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Espoma-14-lbs-Organic-Lawn-Food-100527371/309893027) and [Safer Lawn Restore](https://www.acehardware.com/departments/lawn-and-garden/lawn-care/lawn-fertilizers/7334139).
### I understand that a heavy summer fertilization might not be best, but I really like the way my lawn looks after I fertilize. Is there any way I can get that awesome color in summer?
As mentioned both in the main post and in the question above, cool season grasses struggle in all but the mildest summers. Struggling grass will *never* look as good as flourishing grass. Think of your springtime grass as like your high school prom date when you picked her up. Think of your summertime grass as like your high school prom date eight hours later after drinking many cheap beers and dancing to iffy music.

All that said, there is one thing you can do to improve the color of your grass during summertime. Apply iron. Iron is going to deepen the color of almost any turf. As mentioned in the main post, its presence in Milorganite is part of what makes that fertilizer so popular.

Iron, like so many other lawn products, comes in two forms, liquid and granular. I think liquid iron products like [N-EXT GreeNeEfFect](https://gciturfacademy.com/product/7-0-0-greene-effect-two-2-5-gallon-jugs-5-gallons-total/) or [this product from LawnStar](https://smile.amazon.com/LawnStar-Chelated-Liquid-Iron-Plants/dp/B07LB49QQV) are the better way to go as iron is best absorbed through the grass’ blades than its roots. Both can be applied via [the same hose-end sprayer attachment](https://smile.amazon.com/Ortho-Spray-Multi-Use-Hose-End-Sprayer/dp/B0071D0EZK) linked to in Step #8. For those who prefer granular products, [Ironite](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Ironite-15-lb-Soil-Conditioner-Ironite/50260119) is a cheap and relatively effective option available at virtually any big box store.
### What about Weed & Feed products? Are they any good?
See the WEEDS AND HERBICIDE section above.
## OTHER QUESTIONS
### I *need* a perfect lawn this summer. What are my options?
There are going to be some of you with graduation parties and baby showers planned who simply must have a great lawn as soon as possible. Others are just going to want a “cheat code.”

Thankfully one exists: *sod*. You can install sod at any time your ground isn’t frozen and your local sod farms have it in stock. Sod is going to be expensive, there is no way around that, but it will give you a nearly textbook perfect lawn in virtually no time at all and one that should easily survive summer heat.
### How can I prevent my dog from ruining my lawn?
Dog urine contains a lot of nitrogen. While nitrogen, as we discussed, is good for the lawn, too much can be damaging and when your dog pees on your grass it is almost as if you spilled a bunch of fertilizer on that spot.

The best solution to this problem is to create a “Dog Run.” This means designating an area of your lawn to become the bathroom for your dog. There are lots of options. You can separate the area with chicken wire or border plants. You can leave the area bare, or cover it with gravel or mulch. What matters above all is that your dog takes a liking to the area and you are able to train him or her to use that area and never the rest of the lawn. How to accomplish this would be best discussed on [r/Dogtraining](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/).

The only other reliable option is to follow your dog out to the lawn and immediately water the spot that they peed on. The water will dilute the nitrogen and prevent any damage. While this practice is very effective, it is completely impractical for most people.

There are several options on the market that I would skip. [u/Unabomber007](https://www.reddit.com/user/Unabomber007/) brought up two of the most popular ones in a recent post: vitamin pills you feed to your dog and pheromone spikes you put in your yard. The spikes could have potential use in training your dog to use a Dog Run, but they obviously don’t accomplish anything on their own, and most have terrible reviews, even as training devices. Pills are pretty much an outright scam. To the best of my knowledge, there is nothing you can feed your dog that will reduce the nitrogen content of its urine to a point that it makes it safe for your lawn.
### I have a shady part of my lawn where grass doesn’t seem to want to grow. What can I do?
Grass needs light. We’ve talked a lot about nitrogen so far, but remember that grass, like every plant, “eats” through the process of photosynthesis. No light, no photosynthesis. No photosynthesis, starved grass. You get the picture.

The best thing you can do for shady areas is treat the shade, if possible. Removing trees or even tree limbs so as to allow more light can make all the difference. If you are a beginner, I strongly recommend you hire an arborist to at least make determinations about removing trees or limbs of trees. It would probably make sense to hire that person to do the removal too unless you are well-trained in doing so.

If the areas are shaded by buildings or trees that cannot be removed there are limited options. If you have bluegrass or rye planted in these areas you can oversee them with fescue. Shade-tolerant varieties of turf-type tall fescue like Rowdy, Rebounder, Titanium 2LS and GTO will all handle some shade. Fine fescue (which is a family of grasses that includes hard fescue, chewings fescue, hard fescue and others) will tolerate even more shade.

Realize, however, that no grass is going to tolerate deep shade and look great in the long-term.
### Why are all your links seem to go to different companies?
This was done on purpose so as to prevent accusations that I worked for one retailer or another. Obviously many of the products I recommended could be bought from one store and I encourage you to do that.
