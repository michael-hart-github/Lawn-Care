**GUIDE FAQ - Part 1**
## DETHATCHING
### Shouldn’t I dethatch my lawn this spring?
Like aeration, which I discussed in Step #5, dethatching is best done on cool season grasses in the late summer or early fall. But even then it should *only* be done if needed. While warm season grasses tend to need regular dethatching - which leads some cool season beginners to think they need to regularly dethatch too - this simply isn’t the case.

Before we go any further let’s get clear about just what thatch is: Thatch is a layer of both living and dead organic matter that sits below the crowns of your grass but above the topsoil. (See [this picture](https://www.gardenmyths.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Lawn-Thatch.jpg) to help make sense of this). Despite popular belief, thatch is not usually made up of grass clippings, in fact this will only be the case if you are routinely violating the “1/3rd rule” discussed in Step #11.

In small amounts, thatch can be beneficial. It can prevent weed seeds from germinating, it can regulate temperatures in the top soil and it can help retain moisture. However, once thatch gets excessive it can start to prevent water, air and nutrients from making their way to the roots of the grass. A heavy layer of thatch can also harbor pests and fungus.

So when should you dethatch? Only when your thatch layer exceeds one inch. How do you know when that is? Well, a [soil probe](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Q2W3K4G/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title) is very useful for creating cores like the one seen in the picture above. It is also useful for doing the soil tests discussed in Step #2. That said, it is expensive, and in a pinch [a cheap apple corer](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Apple-Corer-Lever-Tool-by-BRIGHT-KITCHEN-Stainless-Steel-Pear-Fruit-Seed-Remover-Cherry-Red-Grip-with-Serrated-Blade/145999156) will work just fine. (To be clear, many apple corers won’t go deep enough for soil tests, but they will certainly allow you to measure your thatch layer).
### How do I dethatch?
Thatch needs to be raked up. You can do that either with a rake or with a machine. The best options for rakes are specifically-made thatch rakes. [This model](https://www.acehardware.com/departments/lawn-and-garden/gardening-tools/rakes/7674260) from Ames is the standard, but I strongly prefer [The Groundskeeper II](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B4MQNHF/) from TRG. It works better and faster.

Still, no body-powered rake is going to work particularly quickly and if you have a large area you need dethatch it makes sense to use a machine. You can buy one, [this electric model from Greenworks](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Greenworks-10-Amp-14-Inch-Corded-Dethatcher-DT14B00/665298278) is very popular and regularly talked about in this sub. It can often be found brand new on sale for under $100 and used for around $50. But even at that cheap price I am not sure it makes sense to keep a machine around that you might only need to use once every two or three years. For those who don’t want to buy one or those with tons of thatch, the best option is to rent a gas-powered [power rake](https://www.homedepot.com/tool-truck-rental/Self-Propelled-Power-Rake/13061/index.html).

Dethatching is a relatively simple process. Once you get the thatch up you’ll want to “vacuum” it up using your mower with the bagger attachment.
## SEEDING
### Wait, you didn’t mention seeding. Can’t I seed my lawn this spring?
This is a question that this sub gets hundreds and hundreds of times in the late winter and spring. And it makes sense. If your lawn is thin and looks bad, you’ll want to get it looking better as soon as you can. No one who is into lawncare wants to go all summer with a terrible lawn.

Yet for most people reading this, waiting until fall to seed is unquestionably the best strategy. The reason why is simple: cool season grass does *far* better when it is seeded in the fall. When you plant cool season grass in the spring your new grass is not going to have enough time to establish itself before the summer heat arrives. That heat can wipe it out in a matter of a week. Perhaps more importantly, if you seed in spring you are stuck with Tenacity (mesotrione) as your pre-emergent. Tenacity works well but it doesn’t have the longevity or strength that prodiamine or dithiopyr (see Step #6 ) do. The odds that you end up with a healthy amount of crabgrass are high, and crabgrass thrives in the summer heat. It can outcompete both your new and old grass and turn all of your hard work into a weed-filled mess.

Now, it is worth mentioning that in the previous paragraph I used the term “most people.” There are parts of the country that have cool enough summers that they can escape some of the problems associated with spring seeding. The bottom line is this: if you have very few summer days where your high exceeds 85°F you *may* be able to get away with seeding in the spring. Certainly you will be able to dodge the affects of heat, but unless you live somewhere that is downright cold you are still likely to face issues with crabgrass. Herbicides containing Quinclorac (see Step #9) can be applied to knock it back, but oftentimes the damage will already be done.
### Okay, I understand that it is a bad idea to seed my entire lawn but I have a couple bare spots in my lawn. Can I seed them?
If the spots appear to be very small in the late winter or early spring - the size of a baseball or softball - I’d be inclined to leave them as is. Realize that the blades of grass are going to thicken during the spring months and, if properly fertilized, more blades will grow. If you have Kentucky bluegrass in your lawn - and the further north you live, the greater the likelihood you do - it can actually spread into those bare spots and fill them in.

If the spots are bigger - give or take the size of a basketball - you can seed them, if you wish. Understand, however, that these spots are likely to suffer like any other spring-seeded grass.

If you decide to go forward, you’ll want to seed these spots a couple weeks after you put down your pre-emergent (see Step #6). This presents a significant problem as not only will pre-emergent herbicides prevent weed seeds from developing but they will also stop your grass seeds from doing so. The solution is relatively simple and low-tech: when you are applying your pre-emergent put some cut-to-size heavy duty garbage bags over the spots you intend to seed. Be sure to do this both times if you are doing a split-application. Even if grass has germinated and is growing in the previously bare spots, you’ll want to avoid applying a pre-emergent to those areas as the herbicide can inhibit the root growth of your young grass.

For instructions on how to actually seed bare spots, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6iIOn2v0J8Q) from Ryan Knorr.
## WEEDS AND HERBICIDES
### I found this guide in \_\_\_\_. Is it too late to put down a pre-emergent?
It depends when exactly you have found it. Whenever you are using a pre-emergent you need to consider how long it is going to last and how that will affect your plans down the road. Most pre-emergents, even when put down at the lowest recommended dosage, will last for a minimum of three months. And many of you will want to seed in the fall. As discussed above, an active pre-emergent herbicide will prevent your seed from developing. Thus, if you plan to seed in mid-September, you’ll not want to put down a pre-emergent any later than mid-June. If you are in such a situation be sure to choose dithiopyr over prodiamine (see step #6) and have reasonable expectations: you are months late on your application and you are surely going to have at least some crabgrass in your lawn.

If you are finding this guide in late summer, the best thing you can do - in terms of weeds - is kill the ones you have with post-emergent herbicides.
### Are Weed and Feed products any good?
In a word, no. Weed and Feed products, which combine fertilizer with post-emergent herbicides, appear to offer good value and the opportunity to combine two steps into one. In reality, most are made with cheap, low-quality ingredients and don’t work all that well, particularly when compared to a plan like the one suggested in the main post. Weed and Feeds are also deceptively expensive. Spot spraying weeds and applying fertilizers recommended here will ultimately cost less than regularly using Weed and Feeds.
### Do you recommend hose-end weed killers?
No. Despite being a mainstay at big box stores, these are simply too difficult to put down evenly and effectively. When spraying weeds you want precision. These products are the opposite of precision.
### I sprayed weeds and they didn’t die. What gives?
It is not easy to figure this out from afar. Some tips: First, make sure you are applying the right herbicide to the right weeds. Step #9 above is a place to start. Links in the sidebar - particularly for identifying weeds - are also great resources. Second, read the label of the herbicide you are using and ensure you are mixing it correctly. Third, make sure you are applying the herbicide correctly. The weeds should be wet but not drenched. Fourth, understand that some herbicides take as long as two or three weeks to fully kill weeds. Fifth, feel free to reapply the herbicide after a couple of weeks have passed. Some weeds are resilient and will require multiple applications of herbicide in order to die.
